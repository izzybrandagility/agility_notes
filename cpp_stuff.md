# Things I'm learning about C++

 * `[&]` before a function means capture all the variables by reference
 * `<<` is the bitshift operator
 * `std::unique_ptr` is a pointer which deletes the object it points to when the pointer is destroyed
 * `#define SOME_NAME(args) some_body` is a macro. The precompiler replaces every appearance of `SOME_NAME(args)` with` some_body` before compilation
 * when you have a `std::map`, you can initialize a key-value pair without supplying a value: `my_map[key_name]`
 *
