#### Learn a coordinate transform (offline) that improves the QP.

Someone mentioned that the QP WBC doesn't perform well near the extremes, because the true dynamics are being approximated. Maybe we can learn a warping of the state space such that solving the QP in this new space results in better performance near these extremes.
